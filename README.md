# Certificates
I have recently completed a comprehensive PCB Design course, through which I gained a strong understanding and hands-on knowledge of the entire PCB design workflow. I learned to create accurate schematics, design and analyze electronic circuits, perform PCB simulations, and effectively assign the correct footprints to each electronic component.
